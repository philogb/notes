I know we are still one month away from EOY but who knows when I'll get
time to write this so future-me is telling me to do it now :)

Here you can find previous editions for [2014](/notes/2014-in-books/), [2013](/notes/2013-in-books/) and [2012](/2012-in-books/).

Here's the list for 2015:

I took a picture of each book cover right after reading the last page.
Started reading [W ou le souvenir d'enfance](http://www.amazon.com/Souvenir-DEnfrance-Georges-Perec/dp/2070733165/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1449026548&sr=8-2&keywords=georges+perec+W) so I will probably update the list with that book by EOY.

Best book for this year probably goes to "Quelques-uns des cent regrets"
by Philippe Claudel, or "Coco perdu" by Louis Guilloux. I loved St. Exup√©ry's biography by Virgil Tanase as well.

I started (but did not finish) reading Vienna Circle by Victor Kraft.
