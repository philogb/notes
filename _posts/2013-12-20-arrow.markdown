*If there is an object known to everyone, even to savages, and one that
can be used to indicate direction, that object is the arrow. The arrow
leaves a taut bow and always flies in the direction of its point.*

*Whoever chose the arrow as a signal to indicate direction must evidently
have thought of this. And of course, for this purpose, it doesn't matter
if the arrow is made of ebony, teak or a willow wand, if the arrowhead
is made of forged iron or tiger's bone, or whether the flight that keeps
it on a straight course is made of feathers endowed with magic powers to
guide it to its mark. What matters is the shape.*
