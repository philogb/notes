*What mattered most was not prettiness but completeness. It was the
artists' task to preserve everything as clearly and permanently as
possible. So they did not set out to sketch nature as it appeared to
them from any fortuitous angle. They drew from memory, according to
strict rules which ensured that everything that had to go into the
picture would stand out in perfect clarity. Their method, in fact,
resembled that of the map-maker rather than that of the painter.*

*The above picture shows it in a simple example, representing a garden
with a pond. If we had to draw such a motif we might wonder from which
angle to approach it. The shape and character of the trees could be seen
clearly only from the sides, the shape of the pond would be visible
only if seen from above. The Egyptians had no compunction about this
problem. They would simply draw the pond as if it were seen from above,
and the trees from the side. The fishes and birds in the pond, on the
other hand, would hardly look recognizable as seen from above, so they
were drawn in profile.*

*In such a simple picture, we can easily understand the artist's
procedure. A similar method is often used by children. But the Egyptians
were much more consistent in their application of these methods than
children ever are. Everything had to be represented from its most
characteristic angle.*
