In the fifth chapter of [Beautiful Evidence](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Evidence-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392177), 
[Edward Tufte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_tufte) uses [Charles
Minard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard)'s flow map to
describe six Principles of Analytical Design.

The visualization is a *Figurative map of the successive losses in men
of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812-1813.* Minard displays
six variables in different visual encodings: the *size* of the army, its
*two-dimensional location* (latitude and longitude), the *direction* of
the army's movement, and *temperature* on various *dates* during the
retreat from Moscow.

The six Principles described in the Book are:

1. *Comparisons* - Show comparisons, contrasts, differences.

2. *Causality, Mechanism, Structure, Explanation* - Show causality,
   mechanism, explanation, systematic structure.

3. *Multivariate Analysis* - Show multivariate data; that is show more
   than 1 or 2 variables.

4. *Integration of Evidence* - Completely integrate words, numbers,
   images, diagrams.

5. *Documentation* - Thoroughly describe the evidence. Provide a detailed
   title, indicate the authors and sponsors, document the data sources,
show complete measurement scales, point out relevant issues.

6. *Content Counts Most of All* - Analytical presentations ultimately
   stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance and integrity of
their content.

Can you spot those principles in Minard's Map?
