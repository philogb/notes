*(...) Let us try to summarize. Our brain and intelligence have a basis
consisting of gadgetry strictly geared to surviving in a certain type of
environment. Evolution has, rather recently, added to these basic brain
skills some higher functions that perform very flexibly. Possession of
these higher functions have also allowed humans to develop scientific
knowledge. But this, it seems to me, was an accident. The human brain
lacks some basic functions that are desirable for doing science, like
the ability to compute quickly and reliably, or the ability to store
large amounts of data. In spite of these shortcomings, human science has
developed, and we are thus able to understand a lot more about the
nature of things than we had any right to hope for.*

*We live, apprently, in a world full of three-dimensional objects
limited to two-dimensional surfaces. Therefore it is not astonishing that
our brain can cope with such objects: this skill is useful for survival
and encouraged by natural selection. But natural selection does not
explain how we came to understand the chemistry of stars, or subtle
properties of prime numbers. Natural selection explains only that humans
have acquired higher intellectual functions; it cannot explain why so
much is understandable about the physical universe, or the abstract
world of mathematics.*
