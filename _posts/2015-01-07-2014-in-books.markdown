Can't believe 2014 is over already. Following this yearly tradition (?)
that started in [2012](/notes/2012-in-books/) and continued in [2013](/notes/2013-in-books/),
here's 2014 in books:

![2014 in books](/notes/assets/books2014/1.jpg)

Missing there there's:

 * "Trois Contes" by Flaubert, which my grandma
 * "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor E. Frankl
 * "Design as Art" by Bruno Munari
 * "Mathographics" by Robert Dixon
 * "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" by R. Buckminster Fuller

16 are in french, 4 in english.

I started 2 books that I had to drop because I didn't like them: "La
Pianiste" by Jelinek and "Vivre dans la Vérité" by Xiaobo.
