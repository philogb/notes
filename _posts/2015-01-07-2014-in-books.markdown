Can't believe 2014 is over already. Following this yearly tradition (?)
that started in [2012](/notes/2012-in-books/) and continued in [2013](/notes/2013-in-books/),
here's 2014 in books:

![2014 in books](/notes/assets/books2014/1.jpg)

Missing there there's "Trois Contes" by Flaubert, which my grandma
borrowed from me. 17 books, 16 in french, 1 in english.

**Forgot to add**: Design as Art by Bruno Munari, and Mathographics by
Robert Dixon. So 3 books in english and 16 in french.

I started 2 books that I had to drop because I didn't like them: "La
Pianiste" by Jelinek and "Vivre dans la Vérité" by Xiaobo.
