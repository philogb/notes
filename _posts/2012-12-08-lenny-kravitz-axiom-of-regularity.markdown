In mathematics, the axiom of regularity (also known as the axiom of foundation) is one of the axioms of Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory and was introduced by von Neumann (1925); it was adopted in a formulation closer to the one found in contemporary textbooks by Zermelo (1930). In first-order logic the axiom reads:

\\(A \neq 0 \rightarrow (\exists x)\[x \in A\\ \\&\\ (\forall y)(y \in x\\ \\&\\ y \notin A)\]\\)

In introducing this Axiom, Patrick Suppes says:

*It is difficult to think of a set which might reasonably be regarded as
a member of itself. Certainly the set of all men, for example, is not a
man and is therefore not a member of itself. Perhaps it might be argued
that in intuitive set theory the set of all abstract objects or the set
of all sets should provide an example of a set which is a member of
itself, but as we saw in the first chapter, the set of all sets is
itself a paradoxical concept.*

*These remarks suggest we take as an axiom:*

\\(A \\notin A\\)

*However, \[this\] assumption would not prohibit the counterintuitive
situation of there being distinct sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that*

\\(A \\in B\\ \\&\\ B \\in A\\)

*(If you do not believe \[this\] is counterintuitive, try to give a
simple example of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) satisfying \[this\])*.

It's funny that he would say that, because at that very instant I
remembered that a recurrent technique for romantic music composers
is to say that people "belong to each other". Literally [Lenny Kravitz
writes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Belong_to_You_%28Lenny_Kravitz_song%29)

*I belong to you, and you, you belong to me too.*

The 88 also writes something similar in the lyrics of [you belong to
me](http://www.lyrster.com/lyrics/you-belong-to-me-lyrics-the-88.html):

*you belong to me and I belong to you.*

Other examples include the song [I belong to you](http://www.lyrster.com/lyrics/i-belong-to-you-lyrics-anastacia.html)
by Anastacia and I'm sure there has to be like over a dozen of these
examples.

I wonder what would Patrick Suppes say...
