*But it is not marbles, chandeliers, panoramic windows and outrageously
expensive things which make a gentleman's residence. If the person
living in it is a gentleman the house will match him: it will be modest,
quiet, hospitable, and will have all the necessary comforts without
falling over backwards to achieve them. We have all seen old farmhouses
which have been done up, furnished in simple good taste, restored with
due respect for the original architectural style and with the comforts
one really needs. But what we see far more often are Luxuriously
Appointed Freaks lived in any old how, decoraded in the
Arabic-Bergamasque style, filled with fake baroque furniture (as if
there had been no other styles in history), with badly proportioned
rooms and colours that clash with each other and stun the
visitor. These are uncultured houses, built by uncultured builders for
uncultured tenants.*

*When a lot of money comes along before culture arrives, we get the
phenomenon of the gold telephone. And when I say culture I don't mean
academic knowledge, I mean information: information about what is
happening in the world, about the things that make life interesting.*
