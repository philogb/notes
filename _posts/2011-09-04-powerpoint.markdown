*As information gets passed up an organization hierarchy, from people
who do analysis to mid-level managers to high-level leadership, key
explanations and supporting information are filtered out. In this
context, it is easy to understand how a senior manager might read this
PowerPoint slide and not realize that it addresses a life-threatening
situation.

At many points during its investigation, the Board was surprised to
receive similar presentation slides from NASA officials in place of
technical reports. The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint
briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the
problematic methods of technical communication at NASA*.
