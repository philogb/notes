*Besides typing into pop-culture phenomena such as James Bond mania,
Moses had another idea how to increase traffic at the Fair: have the
Weather Bureau take a more "positive" approach in its forecasts for the
area. Rather than saying there was a "20 per cent chance of
precipitation", Moses asked Anthony F. Tancreto, head of the New York
division of the bureau, in a letter, why not say there was an "80 per
cent chance of fair weather"? Amazingly, and as a testament to the power
Moses wielded, the bureau agreed to use the phrase "variable sunshine"
in place of "variable cloudiness". The God-like Moses could, it
appeared, even change the weather.*
