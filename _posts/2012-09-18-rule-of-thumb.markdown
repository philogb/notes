*Since the process of counting is facilitated by the use of the fingers
and toes, it is not surprising that primitive man, like a child, used
his fingers and toes as a tally to check off the things he counted.
Traces of this ancient way of counting are imbedded in our own language,
the word digit meaning not only the numbers 1, 2, 3... but a finger or a
toe as well. The use of the fingers undoubtedly accounts for the
adoption of our system of counting in tens, hundreds (tens of tens),
thousands (tens of hundreds), and so forth*

*There is little question that geometry, like the number system, was
fostered in primitive civilizations to satisfy man's needs. Fundamental
geometric concepts came from observation of figures formed by physical
objects. It is likely that the concept of angle, for example, first came
from observation of the angles formed at the elbows and knees. In many
languages, including modern German, the word for the side of an angle is
the word for leg. We ourselves speak of the arms of a right triangle.*

*Because the Babylonians introduced place value in connection with the
base sixty, the Greeks and Europeans used this system in all
mathematical and astronomical calculations until the sixteenth century
and it still survives in the division of angles and hours into 60
minutes and 60 seconds. Base ten was developed by the Hindus and
introduced into Europe during the late Middle Ages.*

In case you were wondering how the sexagesimal system looked like for the
Babylonians here's a picture of it:
