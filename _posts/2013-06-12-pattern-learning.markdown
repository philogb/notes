*Another factor that affects learning is the degree to which a particular
pattern is already familiar. We would not expect much change in a
subject's ability to identify letters of the alphabet in a short
experiment, because most people have already been exposed to millions of
alphabetic characters. Rapid learning can only be expected for patterns
that are unfamiliar. The change in rate of learning over time is
captured by the "power law of practice" , which has the following
form:*

\\(log(T\_n) = C-\\alpha log(n)\\)

*This law states that the \\(log\\) of the time to respond on the nth-trial
(\\(T_n)\\) is inversely proportional to the \\(log\\) of the number of
trials. The constant \\(C\\) is the time taken on the first trial (or
block of trials).*

*The power law of practice is usually applied to manual skill learning,
but it has also shown to apply to the perception of complex patterns.
Kolers (1975) found that the power law applied to the task of learning
to read inverted text. (...) Initially, it took subjects about 15
minutes to read a single inverted page, but when over 100 pages had been
read, the time was reduced to 2 minutes. (...) Consider a hypothetical
task where peopole improve by 30% from the first day's practice to the
second day. Doubling the amount of practice has resulted in a 30% gain.
According to the power law, someone with 10 years of experience at the
same task will require a further 10 years to improve by 30%. In other
words, practice yields decreasing gains over time.*
