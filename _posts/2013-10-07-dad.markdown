I'm starting a new section called "memories". It'll probably have a
random picture that was taken at some point in life and some text with
some context. I think this will help me remember things.

My dad and I talking in a cafe at the airport in Ezeiza. This happened
in 2011. My dad would come to the airport to say goodbye after I visited
the family in Argentina. In 2011 I was already living in the US.
