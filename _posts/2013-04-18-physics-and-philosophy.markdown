*It has been stated at the beginning that the Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum theory starts with a paradox. It starts from the fact that we
describe our experiments in the terms of classical physics and at the
same time from the knowledge that these concepts do not fit nature
accurately. The tension between these two starting points is the root of
the statistical character of quantum theory. Therefore, it has sometimes
been suggested that one should depart from the classical concepts
altogether and that a radical change in the concepts used for describing
the experiments might possibly lead back to a nonstatical, completely
objective description of nature.*

*This suggestion, however, rests upon a misunderstanding. The concepts of
classical physics are just a refinement of the concepts of daily life
and are an essential part of the language which forms the basis of all
natural science. Our actual situation in science is such that we* **do**
*use the classical concepts for the description of the experiments on
this basis. There is no use in discussing what could be done if we were
other beings than we are. At this point we have to realize, as von
Weiz√§cker has put it, that "Nature is earlier than man, but man is
earlier than natural science." The first part of the sentence justified
classical physics, with its ideal of complete objectivity. The second
part tells us why we cannot escape the paradox of quantum theory,
namely, the necessity of using the classical concepts.*
