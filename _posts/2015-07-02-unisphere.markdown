*In 1961, Moses revealed plans of the Unisphere, at 140 feet in height
and 120 feet in diameter the largest globular structure or
representation of earth ever to be built. Designed by Gilmore Clarke
(with a little help from Moses himself), the Unisphere was (and is) a
twelve-story, 940,000-pound, stainless-steel globe girded by three
orbiting satellites, with illuminated points marking world capitals. The
Unisphere would not just be built by U.S. Steel but also be officially
sponsored by the company, a pulic monument to its status as an icon of
American muscle and know-how and an immensely powerful promotional tool.
Based on the (dubious) claim that Native Americans have little or no
fear of heights and thus make ideal bridge workers, the company brought
a team of fifty Mohawk Indians from the Caughnawaga reservation on the
St. Lawrence River near Montreal to Pittsburgh to build the sphere.
Surrounded by a 350-foot-diameter pool smack in the heart of the
fairgrounds, the Unisphere was always intended to be permanent, unlike
the* [Trylon and Perisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trylon_and_Perisphere)
*, which were demolished and melted down to make
weapons during World War II.*
