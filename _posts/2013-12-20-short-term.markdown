*The secrets of any trade that is pursued with serious intentions are
more than a series of rules and working methods based on logic and
experience and applied so as to obtain the greatest possible effect with
the least amount of effort. They also include a continous process of
observations, thoughts and ideas that are pushed ahead even if at the
beginning they seem to have no logical basis.*

Taken from "Design as Art" by Bruno Munari.
